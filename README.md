Hello, Jambo!

Welcome! Karibu sana!

Thank you for accessing the Jilinde App project Repository.

This document contains information about the Jilinde App Project. Scroll down to find out more.

My name is Peter Omondi Ochieng, a tech enthusiast, Ruby on Rails Learner and a Computer Network Technician professional who grew up in a violent home and seeks to create awareness that will reduce the cases reported in Africa.

Develop an application that will report cases of Gender based Violence to relevant authorities for adults and children to be able to seek help and immediate medical attention. This App will significantly reduce the cases of Gender Based Violence to Women and Girls that includes major incidents like HIV transmission, child abuse(sexual abuse) and  domestic violence awareness, thus provide a conducive living environment for children physically, mentally and emotionally.
Gender Based Violence is just a word that covers many ills done to children, girls and women in both developed and developing worlds and cases go unresolved. My app will be able to unlock all the bureaucratic procedures to assist victims thus accessing medical care and Justice, thereafter seeking pro bono or paid counselling services to secure their future and stop them living with the stigma.

Most of these reported cases always lack prosecution due to lack of evidence from the police. It will be our work to partner with the special Gender desk in each county to train Police handling such cases for effective prosecution.

The persons alerted in this app are all involved in different offices so no one will be able to carpet any case till it’s conclusion that will also be alerted in the application.

Mission: To seek immediate medical care for survivors and initiate prosecution of the offenders.


Summary: Gender Based Violence is just a word that covers many ills done to children, girls and women in both developed and developing worlds and cases go unresolved. My app will be able to unlock all the bureaucratic procedures to assist victims thus accessing medical care and Justice, thereafter seeking pro bono or paid counselling services to secure their future and stop living with the stigma.
