Alt-H1 Contributing to Jilinde.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Jilinde :tada:!

Develop an application that will report cases of Gender Based Violence to relevant authorities for adults and children to be 
able to seek help and immediate medical attention. This App will significantly reduce the cases of Gender Based Violence to 
Women and Girls that includes major incidents like HIV transmission, child abuse(sexual abuse) and domestic violence 
awareness, thus provide a conducive living environment for children physically, mentally and emotionally. 

Gender Based Violence is just a word that covers many ills done to children, girls and women in both developed and developing
worlds and cases go unresolved. My app will be able to unlock all the bureaucratic procedures to assist victims thus 
accessing medical care and Justice, thereafter seeking pro bono or paid counselling services to secure their future and 
stop them living with the stigma.
